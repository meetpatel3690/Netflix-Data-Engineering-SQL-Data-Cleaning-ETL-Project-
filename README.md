# Netflix-Data-Engineering-SQL-Data-Cleaning-ETL-Project-
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering and SQL-based data cleaning workflow using a real-world Netflix dataset. The goal was to transform raw, messy CSV data into clean, structured, and analytics-ready tables that support business analysis.  The project focuses heavily on data preparation, normalization, and staging.
